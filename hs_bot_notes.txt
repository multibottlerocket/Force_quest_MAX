try moving VM to other HDD for better loading times in parallel - cpu doesn't seem to be the issue
try on laptop?
try loading hearthstone on single vm first before booting any others
can i get 3+ VMs running with one of the above?
try SSD? (enough space?)

having 2 VMs running and trying to boot up a third went very, very poorly
	even after the 3rd was booted up, the first two were unrecoverably lagged, even with some reloading of programs within the VM
	CPU was still only 50% on all cores, even with an HD twitch stream running

after running blind loop for long enough to probaly get through the tutorial, make modifications to basic mage deck for better win rate
	add yeti and sen'jin, and any other efficient bodies/big taunts
	remove mage spells except for intellect
	maybe also switch to a loop that trades before going face
		can that loop beat the tutorial?
	what is the actual winrate of the current loop?

figure out what the minimum requirements are for an 80g friend quest game to count
	can you just pass turn back several times and concede?
